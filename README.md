# Casino-Project
This is a simple back end of a casino that was used as a term project in Object Oriented Programming class, in Java. 

The goal was to show that I understood the principles of object oriented programming.
An additional challenge for bonus points was to manually input a merge-sort, which I completed successfully. 

I completely removed the original tests and started testing my code from scratch on April 6th 2019 in an effort to better identify some minor bugs and improve my code whilst using Version control. 


As of April 8th 2019, code is bug free :)
